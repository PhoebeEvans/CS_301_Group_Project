## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **MaandPaRailroadApp/**: Contains the main application code.
  - **src/**: Source code for the application.
  - **res/**: Resource files such as images and layouts.
  - **libs/**: External libraries used by the application.
  - **tests/**: Unit and integration tests.
- **s1_team_proj_idea.txt**: Initial project proposal and brainstorming document.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following dependencies:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 11**: Ensure that JDK 11 is installed and configured on your system.
- **Gradle 6.8**: Used as the build automation tool.
- **JUnit 5**: Framework for running tests.

## Building the Project

To build the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PhoebeEvans/CS_358_Group_Project.git
   ```
2. **Open Project in Android Studio**:
   Ensure most recent version of Android Studio is installed.
3. **Run any Suggested Upgrade Scripts for AGP or Gradle**:
4. **Replace variables with local folder structures and API Keys**:
   In local.properties you will need to update your file path for the SDK, and in local.properties and AndroidManifest.xml you will need to inject your Google Maps API Key.

## Running the Application

After building the project and injecting local variables, proceed to run the program against a virtual device within Android Studio.
